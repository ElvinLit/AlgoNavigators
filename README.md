### Roadmap Considerations

Below lists ideas we considered for further development but were unable to finish due to time constraints.

1. **Precision Itinerary Planning:** Explore detailed, day-by-day scheduling, accounting for activities, wait times, and travel intervals. Potential integration with our own calendar or Google Calendar for enhanced planning.
2. **Cloud Database & Authentication:** Consider expanding our database capabilities with Firebase and streamline user login with Google OAuth for secure, efficient access.
3. **Personalized Chat Bot Persona:** Evaluate options to tailor the chat bot's persona, aligning it more closely with specific user demographics for a personalized touch.
